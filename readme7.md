# Typescript homework seventh session

This code defines a user's type called userType using TypeScript's type annotation. It has several optional properties such as firstName, lastName, age, job, maritalStatus, gender, heightCM, weightKG, ID, and phoneNumber. The gender property can only have the values 'male' or 'female'.

An array called users is then declared, which is an array of objects that conform to the userType structure. Two user objects are initialized and added to the users array.

The code then defines several functions to perform CRUD operations on the users array.

The addUser function takes a new user object as an argument and adds it to the users array using the push method.

The removeUser function takes an ID as an argument and finds the index of the user with that ID in the users array using the findIndex method. It then removes that user from the array using the splice method.

The editUser function takes an ID and an object containing the updated values as arguments. It finds the index of the user with that ID in the users array using the findIndex method and updates the user object with the new values using the spread operator.

The sortUsers function sorts the users array in ascending order based on the default string representation of each element.

Finally, the code logs the current list of users, adds a new user, removes a user, edits a user, sorts the users, and logs the updated list of users after each operation.
